There are two types of problem:
- Risk: we end up moving real money (yikes!)
- Dependency:
	- if we only use staging, what if staging is down?
	- what if staging is slow?


To stretch the stunt double analogy:
- risk: we injure our actor
- dependency: what if the actor is busy? Or ill?

** This is exactly where test doubles come in! **
