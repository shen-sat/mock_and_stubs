The test double we just wrote is aka a 'stub'.

Stubs allow us to swap out real objects with dummy objects with behaviour that we define.

You'll use them when you need a return value in your test.

"Stubs provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside what's programmed in for the test."

Now imagine we add some more functionality...(see diagram)
