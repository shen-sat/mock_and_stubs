The test double we just wrote is aka a 'mock'.

Mocks allow us to swap out real objects with dummy objects and verify behaviour.
Note - this is different to a stub where we we swap out real objects with dummy objects with behaviour that we define.

You'll use them when you need test that a certain behaviour happened.

"Mocks are what we are talking about here: objects pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive."
